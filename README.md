# Space-Invaders-CPP-Visual-Studio
Final Project for CS-3150 at SUU

This project was created for our C/C++ final project in Fall 2021. 
This is far from perfect, but it is our first attempt at object oriented programming in C++.

This is supposed to run in the command prompt, not the terminal of VSC. 


The game runs using 'a' and 'd' to move the character left and right, and use 'f' to fire a bullet. 
If the bad guy touches the bottom of the screen, you automatically lose because as keltonlp said,
"You don't deserve to live if you are a bad pilot." However, the ship you fly can take 3 hits before
it explodes. Check out the ReadMe inside of the file for a few lines of code you will need to run in
Visual Studio Code. You should just be able to run the included .exe without any terminal stuff, but 
if for some reason you can't, then it is included.



We took inspiration from this project by Robot Lobster:
